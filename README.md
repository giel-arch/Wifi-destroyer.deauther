- Click "Stop Scan" to stop the scanning process

#### 2. Scan Results
- View discovered networks in the table
- Columns: Network Name (ESSID), BSSID, Channel, Power
- Click "Select Target" to select a network for deauthentication
- Click "Clear Results" to clear the scan results

### Attack Tab

#### 1. Target Information
- View information about the selected target network
- Shows ESSID, BSSID, and Channel

#### 2. Attack Options
- Set the packet count (1-100) for the deauth attack
- Click "Start Attack" to begin the deauthentication attack
- Click "Stop Attack" to stop the attack

#### 3. Attack Log
- View real-time logs of the attack progress
- Shows timestamps and command outputs

### Tools Tab

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. No WiFi Interfaces Found
- Ensure your WiFi adapter is properly connected
- Run `sudo rfkill unblock all` to unblock all wireless devices
- Try replugging your WiFi adapter
- Check if the required drivers are installed

#### 2. Monitor Mode Failed to Start
- Ensure NetworkManager and wpa_supplicant are stopped
- Run `sudo airmon-ng check kill` to kill interfering processes
- Try restarting your system
- Check if your adapter supports monitor mode

#### 3. Scan Returns No Results
- Ensure you're on the correct channel
- Try increasing the scan duration
- Check if your adapter is in monitor mode
- Move closer to the target networks

#### 4. Deauth Attack Fails
- Ensure you're on the same channel as the target network
- Check if your adapter supports packet injection
- Try increasing the packet count
- Ensure you have the correct target BSSID

### Getting Help
